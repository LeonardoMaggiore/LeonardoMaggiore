## Hello there 👋

I am a PhD researcher in cosmology at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, and a full member of the ESA Euclid Consortium. My research focuses on weak gravitational lensing as a probe of large-scale structure, with particular emphasis on cosmic voids. I work on extensions to General Relativity, including massive-neutrino cosmologies and tests of gravity beyond ΛCDM, such as modified gravity models.

I developed a dedicated weak-lensing tunnel-void pipeline to extract robust void–lensing observables and applied it to modified gravity models such as f(R) theories. It is a 2D tunnel–void finder called **PyTwinPeaks** (Maggiore et al. 2025), designed to identify projected matter underdensities directly from the signal-to-noise of convergence maps reconstructed via ray tracing in simulated light cones. The pipeline, publicly available at https://github.com/LeonardoMaggiore/PyTwinPeaks, has been implemented within a Euclid-like analysis setup and, in a preliminary comparison with the most recent 2D void finder, delivers deeper and less noisy tangential-shear signals.

My current work includes Euclid DR1/DR2 primary cosmology, cross-correlations with space and ground-based surveys (stage III and IV), and constraints on neutrino mass through geometry–growth splits in weak lensing and galaxy clustering. My work makes extensive use of modern cosmological inference and modelling tools, including **BACCO** (https://bacco.dipc.org/emulator.html), **Cobaya** (Torrado & Lewis 2021), and **PyCCL** (https://ccl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and is closely connected to Euclid primary cosmology analyses and validation efforts.
